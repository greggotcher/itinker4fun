Hello, my name is Greg and I am a Network Administrator by day and a Smart Home enthusiast by night.  I enjoy tinkering with electronics, software and the like.  My plan is to chronical my journey turning my "dumb" home into a "smart" home.  This is so I can remember what I did and how I did it and maybe it can help you as well.
